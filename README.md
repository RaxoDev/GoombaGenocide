📝 Game Description
    This game is a Mario-style platformer inspired by Jump King. You play as Mario, but instead of a traditional side-scrolling adventure, the game challenges you with precise platforming and vertical progression. Every jump matters — timing, momentum, and positioning are key. There are no enemies, only gravity and your own mistakes.

    Climb higher, fall harder, and master the art of jumping in this punishing but rewarding platformer.
